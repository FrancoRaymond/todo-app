## To-Do List App

This is a simple, responsive to-do list application built using React and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to add, reorder, check off, and delete tasks. The app persists tasks in the browser's local storage so they remain saved between sessions.

## Features

1. Add Tasks: Users can input new tasks to the list.
2. Reorder Tasks: Drag and drop tasks to reorder them using the framer-motion library.
3. Mark as Completed: Tasks can be checked off, and completed tasks are displayed with a strikethrough effect.
4. Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list.
5. Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in the browserâ€™s localStorage, so they will not be lost when the page is refreshed.
6. Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- React: For building the user interface and handling state.
- Framer Motion: For drag-and-drop functionality.
- Tailwind CSS: For styling the app.
- Local Storage: For saving tasks persistently.


## How to Use

- Enter a task in the input field and click "Add" to add it to the list.
- Check the box next to a task to mark it as completed, which will apply a strikethrough.
- Reorder tasks by dragging and dropping them.
- Click the "Delete" button to remove a task from the list.
- The app saves your tasks automatically, so they will remain available even after refreshing the page.
